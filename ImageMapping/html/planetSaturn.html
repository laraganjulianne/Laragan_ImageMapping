	<p></blockquote>Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second-largest 
	planet in the solar system. It's the farthest planet from Earth that's visible 
	to the naked human eye, but the planet's most outstanding features its rings 
	are better viewed through a telescope. Although the other gas giants in the 
	solar system Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune also have rings, Saturn's rings 
	are particularly prominent, earning it the nickname the "Ringed Planet."</p></blockquote>
